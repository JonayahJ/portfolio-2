            hr.mt-0.mb-5

            p My name is Jonayah Marie Jackson. Everyone calls me Jo. I'm a front end web developer with a background in graphic design, project management, and data analysis/visualization in higher education. At my last position, I wore many hats, and as such, I was responsible for maintaining my team's webpages on the college's website for the better part of two years. It even led me to begin creating basic websites on popular hosting sites like Squarespace and WordPress as a freelancer. The websites that I was creating for my clients made me want to know more that just how to copy and paste random bits of code here and there.

            p Having recently earned a Certificate in Software Engineering from Columbia University, I want to use my knowledge to combine research and creativity to develop user-friendly applications and websites that center facts and learning. Because of that drive, I became known amongst the staff for beautiful visuals and data-driven deliverables for every project.
